# Project Metro System
This project implements a simplified version of a metro system, allowing users to explore routes between metro stops and calculate fares.
### Project Structure:

#### MetroStop: 
Represents a metro stop.
#### MetroLine: 
Represents a metro line consisting of multiple stops.
#### AVLNode: 
Represents a node in the AVL tree.
#### AVLTree: 
Represents an AVL tree data structure.
#### Trip: 
Represents a trip between metro stops.
#### Exploration: 
Represents a queue for exploring metro stops.
#### Path: 
Represents a path between metro stops.
#### PathFinder: 
Implements methods to find paths between metro stops.

### This project provides functionalities to:

Populate metro lines and stops from a file.
Calculate paths between metro stops using an AVL tree.
Calculate fares for trips between metro stops.
